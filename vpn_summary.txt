VPN Summary

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a tool that helps protect your online privacy and security by encrypting your internet connection. It hides your real IP address by routing your traffic through a secure server in another location. This prevents your ISP, hackers, or websites from tracking your real identity or browsing activity.

VPNs are especially useful on public Wi-Fi networks where data can easily be intercepted. They help you access restricted or geo-blocked content and add a layer of anonymity.

However, free VPNs may come with limitations like slower speed, limited server options, or data limits. Also, while VPNs encrypt your traffic, they don’t fully protect against malware, cookies, or browser fingerprinting — so using them along with other security tools is important.
