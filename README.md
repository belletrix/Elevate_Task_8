## Summary
VPNs encrypt internet traffic and hide your IP address, improving privacy and protecting data from eavesdropping, especially on public networks. However, free VPNs may have speed limits and fewer servers. VPNs donâ€™t prevent tracking via cookies or fingerprinting and should be used with other security tools.

## Outcome
Gained hands-on experience with VPN setup and understood how it enhances online privacy.
